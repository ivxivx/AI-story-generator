Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a little boy named Max. He loved to gaze up at the sky every day after school. One afternoon, he noticed something amazing - a big, fluffy cloud shaped like a dragon! Max couldn't believe his eyes and ran inside to tell his best friend, Emma.

Together, they gazed out the window and saw the dragon cloud moving slowly across the sky. They decided to have an adventure and followed the cloud to a nearby hill. As they reached the top, they saw a magical kingdom hidden among the clouds!
