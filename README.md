The program generates a story and two audios (normal, faster) per difficulty level based on user's input.

The program automatically chooses available device (cpu, gpu, mps).

To run the program, you need install all dependencies first, then download and run Ollama locally, followed by the command:
`python apps/story_generator.py`

There is an example under the directory `example/sky` which contains generated story text and audio for the keyword `sky`.
